# SafeScalableOSS-HR

## 👋 Hi, I'm Briana Laurant

I'm a Global HR Compliance Consultant working at the intersection of open-source innovation and U.S. employment law. I help OSS projects and tech startups stay safe, scalable, and fundable by navigating the legal realities of paying contributors, managing remote teams, and building sustainable cultures.

## ⚠️ Why This Matters

Most OSS leaders and startup founders don’t realize this: once you start paying contributors or directing their work, U.S. law may see you as an employer. That triggers wage/hour rules, tax obligations, leave laws, and compliance risks that can shut down your project—or block funding—if ignored.

This repo is here to help you avoid those landmines.

## 🧰 What You'll Find Here

- **Guides**: Plain-language explainers on employment law risks in OSS and startup environments.
- **Templates**: Agreements, onboarding checklists, and classification tools to help you stay compliant.
- **Case Studies**: Real-world examples of what can go wrong—and how to fix it.
- **FAQs**: Quick answers to common questions OSS maintainers and founders ask.
- **Tools**: Lightweight resources to assess risk and plan for growth.

## 👩‍💻 Who This Is For

- OSS maintainers paying contributors or managing teams
- Startup founders hiring globally or scaling fast
- Project leads who want to build responsibly and avoid legal surprises

## ❤️ My Mission

To make HR compliance accessible, actionable, and aligned with the values of open collaboration. You build the future—I help protect it.
