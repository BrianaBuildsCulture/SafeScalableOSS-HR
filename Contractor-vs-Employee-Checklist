# Contractor vs Employee Checklist  
*A compliance-first resource for open source contributors, engineers, and U.S. employers navigating the 1099 vs. W-2 line.*

## 💡 Why This Matters
In the OSS and tech community, contributors are often engaged under the wrong classification.  
This checklist provides **practical guidance** to help determine whether a role is truly **independent contractor (1099)** or should be an **employee (W-2)**.

Misclassification leads to:
- 🚨 Legal penalties & fines for employers
- 💸 Lost benefits, wages, and protections for contributors
- 📉 Risk for startups and OSS projects relying on global talent

## ✅ U.S. Compliance Checklist

### 1. Behavioral Control  
- [ ] Does the company dictate **how** work is performed (methods, tools, schedules)?  
- [ ] Is training provided like to an employee?  
- [ ] Are required tools/equipment provided by the company?  

### 2. Financial Control  
- [ ] Is the individual paid hourly/salary (employee) vs. per project (contractor)?  
- [ ] Can they realize a profit/loss from the work?  
- [ ] Do they market their services to other clients?  

### 3. Relationship of the Parties  
- [ ] Is there an ongoing, indefinite relationship?  
- [ ] Are benefits offered (insurance, PTO, retirement)?  
- [ ] Is the work a **core part of the business**?  

👉 If most boxes are checked “yes,” classification leans **Employee (W-2)**.  
👉 If most are “no,” classification may be **Contractor (1099)**.

## 🌍 Global Notes
Classification rules vary:  
- **EU** → Default leans toward employee protections unless independence is clear.  
- **Canada** → Similar tests: control, ownership of tools, profit/loss risk.  
- **India** → Contractors common, but long-term exclusive relationships trigger employee status.
