# SafeScalableOSS-HR
I’m Briana Laurant, a Global HR Compliance Consultant. I help OSS projects and tech startups avoid U.S. employment law landmines. If you’re paying contributors or directing work, you may be an employer under U.S. law. I keep your project safe, scalable, and fundable—so you can focus on building, not backpedaling.
